[{"id":101,"name":"M. Lane","review":"I've been doing writing on my windows laptop, and the cloud service (One Drive) combined with the windows file system has been driving me crazy. So I was forced to get a mac, which I hate to do. But For writing and travel, this machine is perfect! It's small, has a nice screen and keyboard, doesn't get hot, has a long lasting battery, and iCloud. ICloud may not be perfect","rating":4},{"id":102,"name":"Philipp Reichardt","review":"The MacBook Air arrived even a day earlier than announced, it was a new product and in general as described - I'm very happy with this purchase.Device arrived as expected. Though had to pay $10 for expedited shipping, it was worth it","rating":3},{"id":104,"name":"Clark Beattie","review":"I've owned two MacBook Pros and two iMacs. This Mac is, by far, the best one I've ever had. The battery life is longer the smooth integration of the hardware and software is incredible, even more than other Macs.

I would go with the 16GB but the SSD doesn't need to be larger than 256 when used with the cloud.","rating":4},{"id":106,"name":"Matthew P Smith","review":"I bought this specifically because I was having trouble with my old Roku Premiere+ being able to stream YouTube videos in 4K. It would always default to standard definition or worse and never get any better. ","rating":4.5},{"id":107,"name":"Clark Beattie","review":"I've owned two MacBook Pros and two iMacs.
